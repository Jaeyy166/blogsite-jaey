      <h1>就職活動(Job Hunting)</h1>
        <p>
          I did find a job hiring that is somehow related to my college course. <br>
          the owner reached to and email me the date of interview. <br>
          i did go to the interview, but sadly the manager/ owner said <br>
          said that they didn't accept students even though i only have like <br>
          one subject. kinda sucks cos i really wnated to earn money rn. <br>
          i applied to many job hirings in online websites but only few <br>
          of them reached out to me, like the factory one. <br>
          the employer reached to me and said that my final interview is <br>
          scheduled, but surprise surprise! my summer class prof move our <br>
          online class exactly to the time of my final interview, ended up <br>
          not goihg to the interview. <br>
          <br>
          sometimes, i really think that finding jobs sucks here at the <br>
          philippines, cos the employer requires you 10 billions of <br>
          government ids or insurances, like bro i just wanted to have a <br>
          job here and the job is not that professional to have that kind of <br>
          requirements!<br>
          whereas in japan or any other countries, one id is enough to have <br>
          a part-job! like they do accept students unlike here in the philippines! <br>
          im worried about my future cos am i gonna get a job? like a real job? <br>
          im also wondering how do the working students here managed to be <br>
          employed at the first place right? if they can why i cant get a job? <br>
