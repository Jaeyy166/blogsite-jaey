      <h1>Rainy september</h1>
        <p>
          september is finally here, and theres literally two typhoons <br>
          within the area of the philippines,bruh. <br>
          it rained a lot these days, its almost like a sign that <br>
          ber months is here and the gradual drop of temperature will <br>
          happen. as i was writing this, im actually heating up water to put <br>
          at my bathwater lol. <br>
          2023 went so far, i dont even remember things that happened to <br>
          my life from the past months. my original college classmates <br>
          already graduated and im still here studying shit. <br>
          kinda sad that i got left behind, leaving me a lots of "what ifs" <br>
          still to this day. it was like january when me, sachi and dani <br>
          decided to find their ojt workplace (we didnt go together, just <br> 
          only them lol). as our 4th yesr 1st semester ended, i got <br>
          seperated from them and started my life as an irregular student. <br>
          im gonna admit it, but im kind of lost these days, too. <br>
          with having no part-time jobs and money, and all the people <br>
          ive known already passed ahead of me, im kinda lost like <br>
          no sense of directions, heading into nowhere, not really sure <br>
          what will happen to me in the future.<br>
          heck, even my ojt workplace, i just dont know if any company <br>
          will let me work for them, knowing that i suck at anything and <br>
          is stupid and dumb. i dont know if i will get a real job or real <br>
          good job in the future. <br>
          <br>
          i just dont know man. <br>
          and these rains make me reflect on my self, about the time that <br>
          have passed and about my future. <br>
          im scared and anxious man. help <br>
