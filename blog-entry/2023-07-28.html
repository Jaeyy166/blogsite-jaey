      <h1>First blog entry PogU</h1>
        <p>
          This is my first blog entry in my blog site! <br>
          i'm excited to do and add more stuffs in here, <br>
          like adding some photos i take when traveling, <br>
          adding more art in there and putting actual recipes <br>
          that i'm using when cooking something irl! <br>
          <br>
          I'm also proud and impressed to myself because <br>
          i manage to make a simple ascii art in the <a href="../index.html">index.html</a> <br>
          i'm looking forward on making more ascii art <br>
          and to improve making these type of art for me <br>
          to put in this tiny internet space of mine <br>
