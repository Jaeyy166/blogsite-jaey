      <h1>nursing class and overcoming social anxiety</h1>
        <p>
          finally got to attend my pe class with my nursing student <br>
          classmates, it was awkward but they seemed to be chill. <br>
          we gonna go swimming next week and im nervous already <br>
          as i am typing this blog lolll <br>
          <br>
          some psychology student(i guess) interviewed me about the <br>
          meaning of the colors of philippine flag. <br>
          i forgor what those color means, they said that its from NTSP <br>
          i mean its been 3 years since the last class of our NSTP lol <br>
          the whole interview was so embarassing, that i just cringe the whole <br>
          time when i remember it again <br>
          <br>
          still get a prize ballpen, i think they pity me because of how <br>
          dumb i was this day. <br>
          <br>
          but hey, even though the whole interaction was so painful, <br>
          i didnt reject they request to interview me and that make me <br>
          somewhat proud of myself, because back then, i am literally <br>
          like couldnt even talk to other people unless they were my friend <br>
          but now, i can somewhat talk to stranger nowadays. <br>
          it is a huge improvement for me cos it is a sign that im growing <br>
          and not stagnating. <br>
          <br>
          i hope that i can somewhat get along with my nursing classmates <br>
          and have fun to my uni life alone without my shitty og batchmates <br>
          (i still hate them). <br>
          <br>
          i hope that i'll learn how to swim now lmao XD
