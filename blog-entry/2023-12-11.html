      <h1>2 extra semesters that gone by </h1>
        <p>
          its been a year since i got to repeat some of my back subjects <br>
          and its been a wild ride since then up till now. <br>
          i was so anxious at first, back when i enrolled for 1st semester <br>
          in january, while my original batch mates starts their internship <br>
          i got sad that i got left behind and also scared because <br>
          im actually in new class from now on with new people <br>
          i just said, fuck it, this is the time that i should improve <br>
          and fix myself. i dunno if i did truly fixed myself but <br>
          i feel like i can talk to people again now, because of meeting new people. <br>
          i got new classmates from like 2nd years and 3 years and even <br>
          summer class and 2nd year nursing students too lmao <br>
          im not saying that im suddenly become talkative because i did become an <br>
          irregular student, im just saying that i can somewhat hold some <br>
          conversations or at least ask some questions to my classmates. <br>
          which is the thing i cant do back then when im with my original classmates <br>
          i got classmates from food costing to strategic management to front office <br>
          to pe dancing lol, and up to the lastest, just this semester, <br>
          the pe swimming class with nursing students lollll <br>
          thanks to being irregular, i got to learn how to swim (at least) <br>
          i didnt got to say thanks to my girl nursing classmate who teach me <br>
          some swimming techniques during our finals lol, i didnt even got to ask <br>
          her name tho, meanwhile she got my name coz she asked me lolll <br>
          anyways, nursing students are chill and good classmates despite them <br>
          being so stressed out <br>
          <br>
          2nd semester ends now, im currently on the phase of finding my internship <br>
          company and im really anxious cos im thinking if they would accept me <br>
          despite having no experiences in working <br>
          <br>
          sorry for the essaying, i just cant helo myself but to be somewhat proud to <br>
          myself because i did not run from my mistakes this time and actually <br>
          faced the consequences of my past actions that leads me to being an <br>
          irregular student. <br>
          TLDR: uhhh face the consequences, might see some light behind it <br>
          <br><br>
          来年をまたお会いましょう！
