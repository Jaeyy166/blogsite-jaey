      <h1>First swimming class</h1>
        <p>
          it is friday and time to for my pe class and <br>
          my catering management class. <br>
          we are goibg to swim at the sports complex in malolos <br>
          ,it is my first time going inside there. <br>
          i am embarassed to change into my swimming outfit, <br>
          so i just waited for half of my classmates to get change <br>
          im surprised that there is also another irregular student <br>
          witin our class, i thought im really the only one whose <br>
          different, that makes me somewhat glad, but i know that my <br>
          nursing classmates seems to be chill and welcoming. <br>
          <br>
          we start our swimming class with breath holding practice, <br>
          i just said to my self that just get over it and stop worrying. <br>
          it is also my first time again to be in the pool and getting <br> 
          water through my nose. the water hurts my eyes and nose. <br>
          as we repeatedly did the breath holding practice, i got <br>
          somewhat used to water now. i also got a partner that i need to watch <br>
          to help during her being submerged under the water and when shes <br>
          getting out of balance. <br>
          <br>
          we also did three tricks idk in the water, the jellyfish, turtle, <br>
          and star fish. <br>
          so basically, these tricks makes your hands and feet just not touching <br>
          anything, so you can just float in the water. im doing it but im <br>
          panicking already when my feet rose from the floor. there is just the <br>
          two of us who really cant float or swim. prof makes us practice a bit. <br>
          our classmates helps us and encourage us to not be scared, im really <br>
          thankful to my classmate. 本当にありがたいですよ！ <br>
          <br>
          in the end when we need to perform these tricks,i somehow managed to float <br>
          and not panick and hold my breath for like 10 seconds! <br>
