      <h1>First swimming class</h1>
        <pre>
          it is friday and time to for my pe class and <br>
          my catering management class. <br>
          we are goibg to swim at the sports complex in malolos <br>
          ,it is my first time going inside there. <br>
          i am embarassed to change into my swimming outfit, <br>
          so i just waited for half of my classmates to get change <br>
          im surprised that there is also another irregular student
          witin our class, i thought im really the only one whose
          different, that makes me somewhat glad, but i know that my
          nursing classmates seems to be chill and welcoming.
          <br>
          we start our swimming class with breath holding practice,
          i just said to my self that just get over it and stop worrying.
          it is also my first time again to be in the pool and getting
          water through my nose. the water hurts my eyes and nose.
          as we repeatedly did the breath holding practice, i got
          somewhat used to water now. i also got a partner that i need to watch
          to help during her being submerged under the water and when shes
          getting out of balance.
          <br>
          we also did three tricks idk in the water, the jellyfish, turtle,
          and star fish.
          so basically, these tricks makes your hands and feet just not touching
          anything, so you can just float in the water. im doing it but im
          panicking already when my feet rose from the floor. there is just the
          two of us who really cant float or swim. prof makes us practice a bit.
          our classmates helps us and encourage us to not be scared, im really
          thankful to my classmate. 本当にありがたいですよ！

          in the end when we need to perform these tricks,i somehow managed to float
          and not panick and hold my breath for like 10 seconds!
