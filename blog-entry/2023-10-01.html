      <h1>Twice's concert</h1>
        <p>
          it is now sunday and the last day of 2 day concert of Twice in <br> 
          the philippines. <br>
          me and gf somehow got to go outside the philippine arena to <br>
          at least listen to twice's concert. <br>
          i mean its aight like we literally have no tickets to begin with. <br> 
          so we have ko choice but to just stand outside and listen to twice <br>
          singing their songs. <br>
          <br>
          im disappointed to the concert because you can hardly even feel twice's <br>
          presence outside the venue, you can hardly even hear them sing cos the <br>
          only thing you can hear was the fans inside the venue, shouting so loud, <br>
          louder than twice. so yeah, thats what make me off during our stay there. <br>
          <br>
          there was also a kid, like around 5-7 yrs old, like he is just singing <br>
          twices song. its just cute and somewhat nostalgic. i mean i wish i still <br>
          have the same excitement to twice back in 2020, like that kid. <br>
          but now, i just fall out of twice, i mean even though they <br>
          still produce music, it just feels likesoulless songs now.  <br>
          like, the last album that still feels like twice was their eyes wide open album <br>
          and cry for me. <br>
          the rest of their music after that feels like soulless junk that was mainly <br>
          produced just to cater the western audience.  <br>
          <br>
          im now done with my kpop and kdrama phase. i now despise korean media now <br>
          because of how suffocating it is, like everything is now korean. <br>
          so now im just taking my time and just enjoying jpop now. <br>
          jpop have more variety than kpop, which is like just groups lol. <br>
          <br>
          oh well, but at least i got to hear them eh. <br>
