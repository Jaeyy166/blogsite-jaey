      <h1>Twice's concert</h1>
        <pre>
          it is now sunday and the last day of 2 day concert of Twice in 
          the philippines.
          me and gf somehow got to go outside the philippine arena to
          at least listen to twice's concert.
          i mean its aight like we literally have no tickets to begin with.
          so we have ko choice but to just stand outside and listen to twice
          singing their songs.

          im disappointed to the concert because you can hardly even feel twice's
          presence outside the venue, you can hardly even hear them sing cos the
          only thing you can hear was the fans inside the venue, shouting so loud,
          louder than twice. so yeah, thats what make me off during our stay there.

          there was also a kid, like around 5-7 yrs old, like he is just singing
          twices song. its just cute and somewhat nostalgic. i mean i wish i still
          have the same excitement to twice back in 2020, like that kid.
          but now, i just fall out of twice, i mean even though they
          still produce music, it just feels likesoulless songs now. 
          like, the last album that still feels like twice was their eyes wide open album
          and cry for me.
          the rest of their music after that feels like soulless junk that was mainly
          produced just to cater the western audience. 

          im now done with my kpop and kdrama phase. i now despise korean media now
          because of how suffocating it is, like everything is now korean.
          so now im just taking my time and just enjoying jpop now.
          jpop have more variety than kpop, which is like just groups lol.

          oh well, but at least i got to hear them eh.
