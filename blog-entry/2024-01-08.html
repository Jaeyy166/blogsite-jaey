      <h1>Internship Interview</h1>
        <p>
          today is the day of my first ojt interview. finally a hotel replies <br>
          to my email like fr. <br> 
          im actually nervous on the way while on the bus and on the train. <br>
          struggled to find the hotel because it is also my first time going in <br>
          manila like alone. <br>
          got at the hotel a bit late, other interviewees already on the upper floor. <br>
          i came into the interview room, there is about 6 persons that came today. <br>
          it is really awkward rocking up into the room with full on formal attire <br>
          when the other 5 persons were like they just passed by lmao. <br> 
          the other person is actually interviewee like me, she said she came from <br>
          marikina, me and her were the actual scheduled interviewees today. <br>
          i volunteered to be the first one to interview. <br>
          <br>
          maam katherine is nice, she just asking me about my background only not unlike <br>
          other hr that ask like blah blah blah.  <br>
          the interview went good i think?? there are cringe moments like she ask me <br>
          what is my talent and i was like im good at cramming and she be like, come again? <br>
          and i said cramming like rushing things before the deadline. <br>
          im 100% sure she was already disappointed at me lmao. <br>
          my mind also went blank when she asked me what is my strength, i think like <br>
          a full minute to only say that i can multitask, im cringing on the way home <br>
          remembering that *PainsChamp* <br>
          at the end, she still accepts me and told me to pass me some requirements and i did <br>
          thanked her. <br>
          <br>
          the next interviewee is the other girl. i just waited for her before going home <br>
          since were the only two whos actually scheduled today. shes also done. <br>
          we just talked a bit on the way out of the hotel. she said, maam katherine <br>
          asked what is her strength, she misheard it as strand lol. <br>
          i accompany her to her mom so she wont get lost in there, bid byes <br>
          literally forgot to ask her name since she will become my colleague bruhhh. <br>
          anyways, go to intramuros before going back home, bought pizza. <br>
