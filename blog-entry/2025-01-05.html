        its already 2025 and it didnt even feel like it. a lot of things had happened in 2024 and i still couldnt process it that clearly. <br>
        anyways, im just hping that i`ll get a job this year and be able to do mini day trips somewhere while alone. <br>
        i just wanted to be happy this year, even without a partner, so yeah. <br>
