      <h1>On death</h1>
        <p>
          dad is already gone this day. im currently typing this <br>
          january 30. <br>
          he wants chicken fillet ala king that im eating the night <br>
          before he died, so i did feed him a spoon of chicken fillet <br>
          and rice. he did complain that its oily lol. <br>
          later, after mom go out it buy some biscuits for dad, <br>
          dad ask me to massage his legs cos he says its aching, <br>
          so i did, im really sad inside because dad turn into this state <br>
          in span of a year and half. <br>
          <br>
          we sleep. it was like 2 or 3 am idk i dont remember the time, <br>
          but mom waked me up cos dad is having a fever, me and mom take <br>
          care of dad. i wipe cold towel on him while i ask mom to call <br>
          doctors. doctor said if dad dont get tube on his lungs, <br>
          he will stop breathing. <br>
          mom called tito to come at the hospital too. they decided to <br>
          not put tube. as im tending dad while hes having high fever <br>
          his eyes were just looking lost occasionally looking at me, <br>
          i looked at him too, couldnt look at him because of how much <br>
          he is struggling that night, no, all the time hes alive. <br>
          tito looked out for dad while me and mom sleep at the ground floor <br>
          we came back and the pulmo department doing some injections on him <br>
          and he suddenly stops breathing, i pat his leg to wake him up and <br>
          shake him, but hes not responding anymore, it was daybreak. <br>
          we cried, trying to hold back tears from falling from my eyes. <br>
          trying hard to be tough in front of mom, whos crying hard. <br>
          "so thats it, its just after new years", i said inside my head. <br>
          life moves on, other people dont care or dont know that you lost <br>
          someone this day. <br>
          <br>
          dad, wherever you are now, i hope youre already resting, <br>
          finally able to be at peace, free from pain and suffering. <br>
          pahinga ka na dyan pa, mahal ka namin. <br>
