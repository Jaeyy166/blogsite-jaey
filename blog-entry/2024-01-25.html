      <h1>trips to manila + ojt orientation</h1>
        <p>
          just attended our ojt orienation and im literally assigned <br>
          first into the kitchen, like i cant even cook. <br>
          i can already see my superiors getting mad at me on how bad <br>
          i cooked or preparing the ingredients. <br>
          despite all of my worries about my performance, i do hope that <br>
          i will learn something or many imporntat skills that probably <br>
          makes me a worthy employee in the future, like cooking, like actually <br>
          cooking good food, doing beds, handling big ass trays during service. <br>
          i do hope that i can get along with other ojt's especially those <br>
          in the same department as me. <br>
          <br>
          the next day after ojt orientation, i came back in manila to <br>
          find some apartments, i did saw one that is somewhat liveable. <br>
          didnt get it tho cos not enough money on hand for downpayment. <br> 
          i just resorted on renting dorm instead even though i dont like <br>
          living with strangers in the same room. i have no choice because <br>
          of time constraints. <br>
          <br>
          anyways, good luck on me i guess, i'll update in the future kek <br>
