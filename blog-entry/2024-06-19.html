      <h1>Life lately + first job(burned out already)</h1>
        <p>
          Been busy on my life lately just right after i finished on my internship last May 11. <br>
          too busy to do my intership narrative and go to job interviews in manila. <br>
          i dont know why i did even in a rush to get a job right after finishing my intership, <br>
          i just barely even got some rest after tiring intership and from the amount of paperworks <br>
          need to submit for my grades. <br>
          now i am tired and already having burn out, i dont <br>
          i dont even enjoy my job, all im feeing is stress and pressure <br>
          i feel tired all the time, plus i can't <br> 
          even study japanese anymore and do other things <br> 
          like I use to do <br>
          back when I was still on my internship, <br>
          I don't get paid but I di enjoy my work on the hotel <br>
          but now, even though I'm just like 20 mins away <br>
          From out house, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy my current job, like <br>
          Theres to many shit to do, like youre  supposed to do the job of 2 people but <br>
          You're doing it anyway bcos you don't have any other choice, <br>
          You have to do one thing while doing your main task <br>
          Which will always result on slowing down on production <br>
          like you have to make cinnamon rolls and then <br>
          frost the baked rolls and then dislay it in the fucking hot plate <br>
          like do all of it all at the same time, <br>
          and that is why im always finished rolling late because of how slow things are for me <br>
          and that makes my colleauges probably already hate me <br>
          i am earning money but it cost me my sanity and my mental health <br>
